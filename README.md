# Earthquake_monitoring_simulation_video

Earthquake monitoring simulation video description:
1. Resolution: 1920Ã—1080
2. Frame rate: 25fps
3. The earthquake starts from frame 101 and ends at frame 600, with the first 100 frames being a static period.
4. Simulated Videos: Three different scenarios are presented, with Peak Ground Acceleration (PGA) values of 0.2g, 0.5g, and 1.0g respectively.
5. Video Quality: We provide clear earthquake simulation videos for the three amplitudes. If you need to simulate noise and blurring, please refer to the provided video-Blurred process.py and video-Gauss noise.py files.
6. We have provided the actual values of inter-story drift for each amplitude in the corresponding XLS worksheet.
